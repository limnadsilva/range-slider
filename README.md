I have placed all the range slider relates css codes in wwwroot->MMCoreAssets->MMCss->RangeSlider.css and all the range slider relates js codes in wwwroot->Script->ReusableComponents->RangeSlider.js.

It's div element is added in views->Shared->Layout.cshtml and slider is added inside it using jquery functions from the wwwroot->Script->ReusableComponents->AdvanceFiltCommon.js
